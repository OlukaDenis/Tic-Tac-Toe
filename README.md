# :point_right: How to play

1. The board is built as a sucession of ascending numbers that start from 1 through to 9, the image below represents the board positions.

2. The game then displays player X to start the game. The other player is assigned O.
3. The first player picks a number from 1~9 to reflect the move.
4. Every single move a player makes updates the board, and it will be shown
5. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

# :point_right: Rules

- The game occurs on a 3 by 3 grid of 9 squares.

- Two players take turns only in the un-played squares, the first making X's, the second O's.

- A row is any three squares on the grid, adjacent, diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.

- If one player places three of the same marks in a row, the player WINS! :clap:

- If the spaces are all filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw. :confused:
